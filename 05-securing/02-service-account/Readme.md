[Service Accounts:](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/service-accounts/)
It is a type of non-human account that, in Kubernetes, provides a distinct identity in a Kubernetes cluster. a Service Account is an identity used by a pod to interact with the Kubernetes API. By default, when a pod is created, it is associated with a service account, which provides credentials to interact with the cluster. Every namespace has a default service account named `default`.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: my-service-account
  namespace: default
 ```

Why Use
- To authenticate with K8s the container process.
- User need to setup service account to control the access. If Pods needs to communicate with K8s APls.
- Bind service accounts with cluster role or ClusterRoleBinding to provide access to cluster APls.
- Service account access also manage by RBAC.

Check available service
```bash
kubectl get serviceaccounts
kubectl get serviceaccounts -n development # here n is namespace
kubectl get serviceaccounts -n kube-system # here n is namespace
kubectl apply -f my-serviceaccount.yaml
kubectl get serviceaccounts -n development
kubectl get roles -n development
kubectl apply -f pod-reader-binding.yaml
kubectl apply -f service-account-binding.yaml
# role binding to development
kubectl get rolebinding -n development
```
